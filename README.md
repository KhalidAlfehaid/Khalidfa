## 🚀 About Me

I’m a recent Computer Information Systems graduate with a passion for building smart, scalable solutions.  
My interests span across **Software Development**, **Data Analytics**, **Cloud Platforms**, and **Low-Code Automation** using tools like Pega.  
I enjoy bridging the gap between backend systems, data, and user-focused applications.

My graduation project focused on building a **Smart Parking Management System** using Arduino, ESP8266, and a web-based dashboard built with React and Next.js.

I’m currently learning Pega and preparing for the **Certified System Architect (CSA)** exam. I'm also exploring data analysis with Python.
