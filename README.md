## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate final-year CIS student at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, interested in Data Analysis, Cloud Technologies, and Low-Code Platforms.  
I have hands-on experience with full-stack web development, IoT integrations, and process automation using Pega.

My graduation project focused on building a **Smart Parking Management System** using Arduino, ESP8266, and a web-based dashboard built with React and Next.js.

I’m currently learning Pega and preparing for the **Certified System Architect (CSA)** exam. I'm also exploring data analysis with Python.
